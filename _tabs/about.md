## Background

Hi, I'm Teja Guruvelli, a Cybersecurity and Machine Learning specialist currently pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity at Georgia Tech while completing my BS in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity at Clemson University. I'm passionate about AI/ML, Cloud Technology, DevOps, Cybersecurity, Web Development, and Automotive technologies.

As a car enthusiast who has lived in over 10 states, I enjoy exploring the intersection of automotive technology and cybersecurity. This unique perspective allows me to approach security challenges with creativity and technical precision, particularly in the connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) space.

## Why did I start this site?

I created this blog to:

1. Share practical insights on cybersecurity, AI/ML, and software development
2. Document solutions to complex technical challenges I've encountered
3. Showcase projects from my work at Argonne National Laboratory, Principal Financial Group, and other organizations
4. Connect with others interested in the intersection of cybersecurity and emerging technologies
