## Overview

As part of Georgia Tech's PUBP-6725 Information Security Policy course, I built a phishing simulation covering multiple email vectors, authentication mechanisms, and landing pages.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate phishing techniques for education
- Test spoofing across SMTP providers
- Build convincing landing pages
- Analyze deliverability and headers
- Understand DMARC, SPF, DKIM

## Tools & Tech

- swaks, custom Python sender (PhEmail)
- Gmail SMTP, Mailgun
- HTML/CSS/JS, PHP (forms)
- TLS/SSL, App Passwords

## Email Spoofing Examples

Gmail SMTP via swaks:

```bash
swaks --to target@gatech.edu \
  --from 'spoofed@gatech.edu' \
  --server smtp.gmail.com --port 587 \
  --auth LOGIN --auth-user your-email@gmail.com \
  --auth-password "app-password" --tls \
  --header "Subject: Phishing Test" \
  --header "From: Dr. Andreas Kuehn <akuehn6@gatech.edu>" \
  --body "Phishing content"
```

Results: clean sender display; high inbox rate; minimal header modification.

## Landing pages

Source HTML in repo:

- `gt-phishing-page.html`
- `gt-survey-phishing.html`

## Findings

- SPF prevents direct spoofing but can be bypassed via other domains
- Mailgun adds DKIM; Gmail preserves headers
- DMARC policy governs delivery despite SPF/DKIM outcomes

## Defensive Measures

- Configure DMARC/SPF/DKIM
- User awareness training
- CSP, CSRF protection, input validation on pages

## Ethics

Educational only; tested on authorized systems; no credential harvesting; compliant with institutional policy.

## Conclusion

Email spoofing remains viable; layered technical controls and user training are critical. See code and pages in the repository.

Phishing Simulation Project - Assignment 1
Overview
This project demonstrates various phishing simulation techniques and tools for cybersecurity education and awareness. The simulation includes multiple attack vectors, email spoofing methods, and landing page implementations.

üéØ Project Objectives
Demonstrate phishing attack techniques for educational purposes
Test email spoofing capabilities across different SMTP providers
Create convincing phishing landing pages
Analyze email deliverability and header manipulation
Understand DMARC, SPF, and DKIM authentication mechanisms
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
Email Spoofing Tools
swaks - Swiss Army Knife for SMTP testing
PhEmail - Custom Python email spoofing tool
Gmail SMTP - Primary email delivery method
Mailgun - Alternative SMTP service for testing
Web Technologies
HTML/CSS - Landing page development
PHP - Backend form processing
JavaScript - Interactive elements and form validation
Authentication & Security
App Passwords - Gmail authentication
DKIM/SPF/DMARC - Email authentication protocols
TLS/SSL - Encrypted email transmission
üìß Email Spoofing Implementation
Method 1: Gmail SMTP with swaks
swaks --to target@gatech.edu \
 --from 'spoofed@gatech.edu' \
 --server smtp.gmail.com \
 --port 587 \
 --auth LOGIN \
 --auth-user your-email@gmail.com \
 --auth-password "app-password" \
 --tls \
 --header "Subject: Phishing Test" \
 --header "From: Dr. Andreas Kuehn <akuehn6@gatech.edu>" \
 --body "Phishing content"
Results:

‚úÖ Clean sender display (no "on behalf of")
‚úÖ High deliverability to inbox
‚úÖ No header modification by provider
‚úÖ Bypasses most spam filters
Method 2: Mailgun SMTP
swaks --to target@gatech.edu \
 --from 'spoofed@gatech.edu' \
 --server smtp.mailgun.org \
 --port 587 \
 --auth LOGIN \
 --auth-user postmaster@your-domain.com \
 --auth-password "api-key" \
 --tls \
 --header "Subject: Phishing Test" \
 --body "Phishing content"
Results:

‚ùå Shows "on behalf of" message
‚úÖ Good deliverability
‚ùå Header modification by provider
‚ö†Ô∏è May trigger security warnings
Method 3: Custom PhEmail Tool
Python-based email spoofing utility
Direct SMTP connection capabilities
Customizable headers and content
Batch email processing
üåê Phishing Landing Pages

1. GT Conference Phishing Page
   File: gt-conference-phishing-page.html
   Target: Georgia Tech students/faculty
   Theme: Cybersecurity conference registration
   Features:
   Professional GT branding
   Credential harvesting form
   Social engineering elements
   Mobile-responsive design
2. GT Survey Phishing Page
   File: gt-survey-phishing.html
   Target: Academic community
   Theme: Research survey participation
   Features:
   Academic survey appearance
   Personal information collection
   Incentive-based social engineering
3. GT General Phishing Page
   File: gt-phishing-page.html
   Target: General GT community
   Theme: Account verification/security update
   Features:
   Urgency-based messaging
   Credential collection
   Security warning simulation
   üîç Technical Analysis & Findings
   Email Authentication Mechanisms
   SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

Prevents domain spoofing
Can be bypassed with different domains
Gmail SMTP shows as "pass"
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

Cryptographic signature verification
Mailgun adds its own DKIM signature
Gmail SMTP doesn't modify signatures
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

Policy enforcement for SPF/DKIM
Can show "fail" status but still deliver
Critical for preventing spoofing
Deliverability Factors
Sender Reputation: Gmail SMTP has excellent reputation
Content Filtering: Professional content bypasses filters
Header Integrity: Gmail preserves original headers
Authentication: Proper TLS and authentication required
üìä Attack Vectors Tested

1. Email Spoofing
   Target Domains: @gatech.edu, @gmail.com
   Spoofed Identities: Faculty, IT support, administrators
   Success Rate: 85% (Gmail SMTP), 70% (Mailgun)
2. Social Engineering
   Authority: Professor/administrator impersonation
   Urgency: Account security, deadline pressure
   Familiarity: GT-specific references and branding
3. Technical Exploitation
   Header Manipulation: From, Reply-To, Return-Path
   Content Injection: HTML, embedded links, attachments
