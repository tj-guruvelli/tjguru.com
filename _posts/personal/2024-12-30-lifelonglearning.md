## Why this page exists

I use this site as my public notebook. It’s where I turn raw experience into reusable knowledge: short checklists, longer write‑ups, and project logs. My background is software engineering and cybersecurity (OMSCyber at Georgia Tech), so my learning is biased toward systems, security, and shipping real projects.

## Principles I follow

- **Build-first learning**: pick a real problem, build the smallest useful thing, then iterate.
- **Write to understand**: every project gets a short write‑up with decisions, pitfalls, and links to source.
- **Depth over breadth**: focus on at most 3 themes per year; say no to the rest.
- **Evidence-driven**: measure output (posts, shipped features, labs completed) rather than hours spent.
- **Sustainable cadence**: protect health and flow; consistency beats intensity.

## My learning OS (operating system)

1. Capture: dump notes, links, and commands while working.
2. Curate: distill into checklists, diagrams, or scripts I can reuse.
3. Build: turn the idea into a project, lab, or automation.
4. Share: publish a post or repo; include setup, pitfalls, and security considerations.
5. Iterate: revisit and level up the design, performance, or security posture.

## 2025 themes and outcomes

- Health and high-output routines: sleep, lifting, and timeboxing to sustain deep work.
- Systems and reliability: Linux, networks, containers, and performance debugging.
- Security engineering: web app security, threat modeling, and hands-on labs.
- LLMs and agents: practical RAG, prompts, evaluation, and guardrails.

Planned output:

- 12 public posts (deep dives or project write‑ups)
- 4 full security/project write‑ups with artifacts
- 2 open‑source contributions or published tools
- 2 talks or internal demos

Backlog (consciously parked): 3D printing, robotics.

## Recent years (selected)

- **2024**: Wrapped up OMSCyber; focused on security labs and larger write‑ups. Started standardizing post formats and assets on this site.
- **2023**: Heavy coursework; project-driven study and documentation mindset cemented.
- **2022**: Committed to the graduate program; doubled down on systems, security, and writing.

Older logs kept for personal reference; I now optimize for fewer, higher‑quality artifacts that compound over time.
